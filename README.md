# HammerTime

Are you tired of writing code and not getting the desired solution the proper way?
Then you are in the right place! HammerTime lets you release all of that frustration and hammer down
your code until you get it done! Simple and satisfying :D
Now come and be ready for... HAMMER TIME!

## It's hammer time!
You know the drill: Someone created some buggy code and pushed it to production! Now it's up to the other developers to hammer down those errors...
This game is built using Unity, and we are participating in the Miniclip challenge!

## How it works
In this awesome multiplayer game, you need: a player or two, a keyboard and the willpower to hammer down those pesky errors! On each level, you'll be presented with a few lines of code: Can you detect where the errors are? Hammer them down and run the code again!
